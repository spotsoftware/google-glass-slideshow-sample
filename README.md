google-glass-slideshow-sample
=============================

This sample demostrates how to build a glassware which takes advantage of the slide show feature offered by Google Glass SDK.

<b>Informations</b>
<br>
We started from the base sample that can be found on <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/ui-widgets#scrolling_cards_in_immersions">Google Glass Developers Guide</a>: it shows in a very simple way how to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/reference/com/google/android/glass/widget/CardScrollView">CardScrollView</a> widget.

Then we explored a bit deeper this nice GDK's feature and played with it customizing the example above.

The slide show feature can be implemented only using an <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/immersions">Immersion</a>, otherwise it's not possible to benefit of  the required gestures.

<b>Development informations</b>
<br>
The project was written using the latest version of <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=sk">Google ADT Bundle</a>, but it's compatible also with the official <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio IDE</a>.
<br>
It compiles and runs fine with the 17th release of Google Glass XE (Explorer Edition).
